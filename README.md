# Banking Application
1. OOP - BSC20921 - Semester 1 - Dorset College.
2. 22931 - Marcos Oliveira.

# Completed
1.	All the necessary classes so far
2.	A Drive class that push all the code
3.	A menu for both, Bank Employee and Customer with Pin and Password 
4.	The Bank Employee can create new users, and they will have a Current and Saving account 

# Doing
1. As a bank employee you can create and see a List of users created
2. Trying to understand how can I add a value and it can be saved in the Current or Saving account of my user
3. Users can just log in if they have an account already

# To do list
1.	To login, a customer must enter their name, account code and a pin number for their account and
	check if their counts already exist

# Could not do
1. A method that saves money, add or subtract for their accounts, because the value that it is showing
	is from a local variable, once that I restart my program, the value is lost.
2. Delete customers

# Challenge
0. To understand which class should I have what, method, constructor, variables...
1. Methods static, voids, return, and how to pass parameters to this method.
2. To create the savings and current .txt and save the user info there, was a big challenge for me;
3. The main menu will always display the name and actual balance, but to do that, was very challenging,
	because I needed to move the method "LoginEmployee" and "LoginCustomer" from my Drive class, to the its class.
